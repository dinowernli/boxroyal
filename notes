Grid (nodes ("squares") connected in cardinal directions)

Respawn vs permadeath:
  - permadeath makes first kill massively increase win%
  -> respawns

Respawn mechanism TBD
  - should spawn out of range of enemy fire.

Options:
  - random location out of line of fire
  - fix spawn locations, wait until safe
  - random location, spawn cooldown, have chance to regroup
  - spawn locations which are triggered by actor proximity (given #actors < max#actors)
